A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/Rafase282/pen/JYeVmx.

 Web App with the following features:

1. As a user, I am presented with a random series of button presses.
2. As a user, each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
3. As a user, I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
4. As a user, if I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
5. As a user, I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
6. As a user, if I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
7. As a user, I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
8. As a user, the tempo of the game speeds up incrementally on the 5th, 9th and 13th step.
9. As a user, I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
